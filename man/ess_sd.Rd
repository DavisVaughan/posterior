\title{Effective sample size}
\usage{
ess_sd(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 2D array \emph{without} warmup draws (# iter * # chains).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value for the effective sample size
estimate for standard deviation estimate.
}
\description{
Compute effective sample size estimate for standard deviation (s)
estimate of one parameter. This is defined as minimum of effective
sample size estimate for mean and mean of squared value.
