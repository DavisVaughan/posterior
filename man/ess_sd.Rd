\title{Effective sample size for the standard deviation}
\usage{
ess_sd(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 2D array of draws (iterations x chains).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value.
}
\description{
Compute an effective sample size estimate for the standard deviation (SD)
estimate of a single variable. This is defined as minimum of effective
sample size estimate for mean and mean of squared value.
}
\examples{
data("draws_eight_schools")
mu <- extract_one_variable_matrix(draws_eight_schools, "mu")
