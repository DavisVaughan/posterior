\title{Effective sample size for the standard deviation}
\usage{
ess_sd(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{One of:
\itemize{
\item A 2D array of draws (iterations x chains).
\item An \code{\link{rvar}}.
}}
}
\value{
If the input is an array,
returns a single numeric value. If any of the draws is non-finite, that is, \code{NA},
\code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if
all draws of a variable are the same, that is, if draws are constant, the
returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA} as well. The reason for the latter is
that, for constant draws, we cannot distinguish between variables that are
supposed to be constant (e.g., for a diagonal element of a correlation
matrix, which will always be 1) or variables that just happened to be
constant because of a failure of convergence or other problems in the
sampling process.

If the input is an \code{\link{rvar}}, returns an array of the same dimensions as the
\code{\link{rvar}}, where each element is equal to the value that would be returned by
passing the draws array for that element of the \code{\link{rvar}} to this function.

\description{
Compute an effective sample size estimate for the standard deviation (SD)
estimate of a single variable. This is defined as minimum of effective
sample size estimate for mean and mean of squared value.
