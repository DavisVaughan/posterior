\title{Monte Carlo standard error for the standard deviation}
\usage{
mcse_sd(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{One of:
\itemize{
\item A 2D array of draws (iterations x chains) from a single variable.
\item An \code{\link{rvar}}.
}}
}
\value{
If the input is an array,
returns a single numeric value. If any of the draws is non-finite, that is, \code{NA},
\code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if
all draws of a variable are the same (constant), the returned output will be
(numeric) \code{NA} as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant
draws, we cannot distinguish between variables that are supposed to be
constant (e.g.,  a diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or
variables that just happened to be constant because of a failure of
convergence or other problems in the sampling process.

If the input is an \code{\link{rvar}}, returns an array of the same dimensions as the
\code{\link{rvar}}, where each element is equal to the value that would be returned by
passing the draws array for that element of the \code{\link{rvar}} to this function.

\description{
Compute the Monte Carlo standard error for the standard deviation (SD) of a
single variable using Stirling's approximation and assuming approximate
normality.
