#' @description The \pkg{posterior} package is intended to provide useful tools
#'   for both users and developers of packages for fitting Bayesian models or
#'   working with output from Bayesian models. The primary goals of the
#'   package are to:
#'   * Efficiently convert between many different useful formats of
#'     draws (samples) from posterior or prior distributions.
#'   * Provide various summaries of draws in convenient formats.
#'   * Provide implementations of state of the art MCMC diagnostics without
#'     requiring a dependency on packages like \pkg{rstan}.
