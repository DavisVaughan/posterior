Description: The posterior package is intended to provide useful tools for both
  users and developers of packages for fitting Bayesian models or working with 
  output from Bayesian models. The primary goals of the package are to: 
  (a) Efficiently convert between many different useful formats of
  draws (samples) from posterior or prior distributions.
  (b) Provide various summaries of draws in convenient formats.
  (c) Provide lightweight implementations of state of the art MCMC diagnostics.
